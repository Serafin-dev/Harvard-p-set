# Harvard-p-set: DNA
DNA is part of a series of p-sets from Harvard course "Introduction to computer science". A python file handling fun experience. 

I have a good memory about this exercise because I managed to include a recursive function that solved an important functionality of the exercise and it made it more clean as well. 

## Inside DNA folder above you'll find a dna.py(the program)file and a .pdf file(description and constraints). 
### In order tu run it you just need to write to the command line: python dna.py databases/example.csv sequences/example.txt

You can download it and test it yourself...be my guest.
