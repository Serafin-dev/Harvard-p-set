# Harvard-p-set: DNA
DNA is part of a series of p-sets from Harvard course "Introduction to computer science". A python file handling fun experience. 

I have a good memories about this exercise because I managed to include a recursive function that solved an important functionality of the exercise and it also made the code cleaner 

#### Inside DNA folder above you'll find a dna.py(the program)file and a .pdf file(description and constraints). 
In order tu run it you just need to write to the command line: **python dna.py databases/example.csv sequences/example.txt**
You can download it and test it yourself...be my guest.
Also, if you want to know more about the course, you can find it here. I really enjoyed doing it. Have a great day.
